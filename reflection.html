  <p align="center"><strong>Prelim</strong></p>
  <p align="center">I learned the basics of photoshop editing. Fixing/Restoring images, making vectors, applying filters, using lasso tools, transforming photos, etc.</p>
  <p align="center">Activity 1: <a href="images/01 Computer Screen.jpg">Computer Screen</a></p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to put a picture on a computer screen  by distorting the picture. I learned that you can <br>
  distort a picture through Transform → Distort. By distorting a picture, you can adjust the corners of the picture <br>
  and change the direction the picture is facing.</p>
<p align="center">Activity 2: <a href="images/02 Out of Bounds.jpg">Out of Bounds</a></p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to make an out of bounds effect on a  picture of a girl on a swing. The first thing I did was <br>
  draw a  rectangular marquee tool that will serve as the border of the picture  later. After that, I put a layer mask on <br>
  the out of bounds parts, in  this case, the hair of the girl. Then, I put a border by applying  stroke on the rectangular <br>
  marquee that I previously made. Lastly, I  added a background that suits the photo and put it at the bottom  layer.</p>
<p align="center">Activity 3: <a href="images/03 Drawing Effect.jpg">Drawing Effect</a></p>
<p align="center">In this activity,  I learned how to make a drawing effect of a  picture. The first thing I did was duplicate the background <br>
  layer and  change the blending mode of the copy to Color Dodge which is on top  of the original background layer. <br>
  I then inverted the image by  holding CTRL while pressing I. After that, I used Gaussian Blur until  I can see the outlines of <br>
  the original image. You can find Gaussian  Blur in Filter → Blur → Gaussian Blur. After that, I desaturated  the image by adding <br>
  an adjustment layer and turning the saturation  all the way down to -100. Finally, I adjusted the black and whites in  the <br>
  image by adding an adjustment layer and playing with the levels.</p>
<p align="center">Activity 4: <a href="images/04 Fire Text Effect.jpg">Fire Text Effect</a></p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to make a fire effect of a text.  First, I made a text &ldquo;Fire&rdquo; on a black background. Then, <br>
  I  adjusted the properties of the text which made it appear red. After  that, I took a few fire images from another source <br>
  and put it on the  text at the same time adjusting it so that it looks like the fire is  burning on the text.</p>
<p align="center">Activity 5: <a href="images/05 Tilt Shift Effect.jpg">Tilt Shift Effect</a></p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to put a tilt shift effect on a  photo. I simply blurred the upper and lower part of the image <br>
  leaving  the middle part untouched. I think this effect is appropriate on  pictures of good scenery. </p>
<p align="center">Activity 6: <a href="images/06 Glowing Text Effect.jpg">Glowing Text Effect</a></p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to make a glowing effect on a text.  This is similar to the fire text effect. The difference is I <br>
  adjusted  the background this time. I chose the color green because I thought  it will be soothing for my eyes but I was wrong.</p>
<p align="center">Activity 7: <a href="images/07 Starburst Effect.jpg">Starburst Effect</a></p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to make a starburst effect and a  vector. I made the starburst effect by using only the gradients <br>
  and  other filters. Later, I turned it to a vector.</p>
<p align="center">Activity 8: <a href="images/08 Photo to Sketch.jpg">Photo to Sketch Transition</a></p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to make a transition from photo to  sketch effect. First, I chose an appropriate background <br>
  for this  effect which is a good scenery and a very noticeable subject, in this  case, the shrine. After that, I went to <br>
  Filter → Stylize → Find  Edges. And then, I desaturated the image by Image → Adjustments →  Desaturate. Then, I put a layer <br>
  mask and added a black and white  gradient over the image. This is the result. This image is taken from  Thailand.</p>
<p align="center">Activity 9: <a href="images/09 Fiery Portrait.jpg">Fiery Portrait</a></p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to put flames on a girl. I simply  took a few fire from another source and put it around <br>
  the girl. And  then, I carefully adjusted the properties of the flames such as its  opacity and blending mode to fit the <br>
  image. This is a cool effect in  my opinion.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Midterm</strong></p>
<p align="center">I learned how to use DreamWeaver to design webpages. I find it easy because the interface is easy to learn. There are also many useful tools.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Finals</strong></p>
<p align="center">I learned how to make flash animations using Adobe Flash. It is fairly easy to do if you are<br>
  patient. It's not hard to make animations, it just takes  time to animate. But when you are<br>
  used to it, it will be a fun hobby. I even think of making animations and uploading them to<br>
  youtube. </p>
<p align="center">My First Movie</p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned the basics of flash; making use of different layers, creating<br>
  buttons, importing sounds, adding code snippets and using the basic tools.</p>
<p align="center">Frame-by-Frame Animation</p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to create a frame-by-frame animation. It is fairly easy<br>
  because all you need to do is insert keyframes and then move the object. Repeat it several<br>
  times and you are done!</p>
<p align="center">Classic Tween</p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to make an animation using classic tween. In my opinion, this<br>
  is the easiest way to animate a moving object.</p>
<p align="center">Guided Classic Tween</p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to create an animation using guided classic tween. I never knew the pencil tool has another use beside drawing.</p>
<p align="center">Shape Tween</p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to create an animation using shape tween. It's amazing how<br>
  you can just right click and select shape tween to transform an object to another. I'm<br>
  amaze. Much wow.</p>
<p align="center">Basketball</p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to make an animation in a rush.</p>
<p align="center">Car Parking</p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I applied what I've learned before. I think it was easy because I'm already<br>
  familiar with the tools.</p>
<p align="center">Code Snippets</p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I learned how to use code snippets. It is fairly easy to do because all you<br>
  need to do is select it from a list of actions and the code will automatically be generated.</p>
<p align="center">Slideshow</p>
<p align="center">In this activity, I made a slideshow of pictures from the prelim. I also learned how to create<br>
  fade effects by changing the alpha of the images. This is the activity I enjoyed the most.</p>
